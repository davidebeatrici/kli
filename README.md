# K(eyboard)L(ayout)I(nstaller)

[![Build status](https://dev.azure.com/davidebeatrici/kli/_apis/build/status/CI?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/davidebeatrici/kli/_build/latest?definitionId=6&branchName=master)

This is a project I decided to create as soon as I realized [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134) doesn't support ARM64.

In addition to supporting all modern architectures, the main objective is to provide a flexible installer that can be used as replacement for the MSI packages built by MSKLC.
